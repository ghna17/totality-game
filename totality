Players will choose a number of rounds to play.

In each round:
- Player 1 will roll 3 dice. They are trying to get the highest total possible on the three dice, but dice with same value MUST be multiplied together.
- After rolling 3 dice, Player 1 has the option to end their turn or re-roll 1 of the dice in an attempt to get a higher score. 
- Player 2 then gets a turn to do the same thing. 
- After player 2 has finished, the final scores are compared to determine the winner.
- The player with higher score receives 1 point for the round.

Points are totaled after the final round and the winner will be declared.

LET THE GAME BEGIN!"""
